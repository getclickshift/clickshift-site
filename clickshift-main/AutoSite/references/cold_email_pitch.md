# Premium Support Workflow Consulting - Cold Email Strategy

## Subject Line Options:
1. "Before you hire 2 more support agents..."
2. "We studied 500+ support workflows - yours might need this"
3. "47 unnecessary clicks per ticket (here's how we found them)"
4. "Support workflow audit - TechCorp case study"

---

## Primary Email Template - Consultative Approach:

**Hi [Name],**

I noticed [Company] is hiring support agents. Before you add headcount, wanted to share how TechCorp avoided hiring 3 agents and cut response times 40%.

**What we discovered:**
After studying their workflow for 2 weeks (screen recordings, agent shadowing, click mapping), we found their 8-person team was making 47 unnecessary clicks per ticket.

**The hidden costs:**
- 2.3 hours/day lost to tab-switching between Zendesk → Salesforce → Internal docs
- 4+ second delays for each context switch (adds up to 18 minutes/ticket)
- Mental fatigue from constant tool-jumping

**Our solution:**
We built a custom browser extension that eliminated 43 of those 47 clicks. Everything now happens inside their support platform:
- Customer data from Salesforce appears automatically
- Internal KB searches with one-click paste
- Form auto-population from existing customer data
- External tool access without leaving the ticket

**The process:**
- **Week 1-2:** Deep workflow analysis (we even built quick copy-paste shortcuts while studying)
- **Week 3-4:** Custom extension development for their exact setup
- **Week 5:** Testing and refinement with their team

**ROI:**
- Avoided hiring: $225K/year (3 agents × $75K)
- Response time: 4 hours → 90 minutes
- Agent satisfaction: Up 60% (less frustration)
- Our investment: $2K/month

**Would you be open to a workflow audit call?** We can identify your biggest inefficiencies in 20 minutes and show you exactly what TechCorp's extension looks like in action.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. We're workflow engineers, not just developers. That's why our extensions feel like they were always part of your system.

## Follow-up Email - Quick Wins Focus:

**Subject: "Quick win while we talked - copy/paste demo"**

Hi [Name],

Since you mentioned your team does a lot of copy-pasting between systems, I recorded a 2-minute demo of something we can build this week:

[Link to demo video]

This is just highlighting text and having it auto-populate in your forms - no complex integration needed. Takes us about 3 days to build.

The real magic happens when we do the full workflow analysis and build the comprehensive extension, but wanted to show you a quick win first.

Worth a brief call to see your current workflow?

[Your name]

## LinkedIn Message - Research-Heavy Version:

Hi [Name] - saw you're hiring support agents. Quick question: has anyone ever done a forensic analysis of your support workflow?

We just studied TechCorp's 8-person team and found they were making 47 unnecessary clicks per ticket. Built them a custom extension that eliminated 43 of them.

They avoided hiring 3 agents and cut response times 40%.

Worth a 15-minute workflow audit call?

## Discovery Call Framework:

### **Opening (5 mins):**
"Before we dive in, I want to understand your current workflow. Can you walk me through what happens from when a ticket comes in to when it's resolved? I'm going to take notes on every system you mention."

### **Workflow Mapping (10 mins):**
- "What systems do you switch between?"
- "How many clicks does it take to pull customer data?"
- "Where do agents look up common answers?"
- "What gets copy-pasted most often?"

### **Pain Point Validation (3 mins):**
- "What's the most frustrating part for your agents?"
- "Where do you see the most time waste?"
- "If you could eliminate one step, what would it be?"

### **Demo Positioning (2 mins):**
"Based on what you've told me, I can see exactly where we'd focus. Let me show you how this worked for TechCorp who had a very similar setup..."

## Case Study Template - TechCorp Example:

### **Before Analysis:**
- 8 support agents handling 180 tickets/day
- Average resolution time: 4 hours
- Tools: Zendesk, Salesforce, Confluence, Help center
- Agent complaint: "Too much clicking and switching"

### **Our Workflow Audit Found:**
- 47 clicks per average ticket

- 23% of time spent navigating between tools
- 156 copy/paste actions per agent per day

### **Solution Built:**
Custom browser extension with:
- Auto-population of customer data from Salesforce
- In-line search of Confluence with one-click paste
- Help center access without leaving ticket
- Form auto-completion based on ticket context

### **Results After 30 Days:**
- Same 8 agents now handle 250+ tickets/day
- Response time: 90 minutes average
- Clicks per ticket: 4 (down from 47)
- Agent satisfaction: +60%
- Hiring plans: Cancelled (saved $225K)

## Positioning Strategy:

### **You Are NOT:**
- A software vendor
- Selling a generic tool
- Promising quick fixes
- Competing on price

### **You ARE:**
- Workflow consultants who build custom solutions
- Engineers who study inefficiency scientifically
- Specialists in support team optimization
- Premium consultative service

### **Key Differentiators:**
1. **Deep Analysis:** "We study workflows like forensic scientists"
2. **Custom Solutions:** "Built for your exact process, not generic workflows"
3. **Proven Process:** "2-week analysis → custom build → measurable results"
4. **Premium Positioning:** "We're the efficiency engineers teams call when hiring isn't the answer"

### **Pricing Psychology:**
- Never lead with price
- Always lead with cost avoidance
- Frame as investment, not expense
- Compare to hiring costs, not other software

### **Social Proof Strategy:**
- Use specific metrics (47 clicks → 4 clicks)
- Reference workflow complexity they'll recognize
- Show ROI in hiring avoidance terms
- Mention agent satisfaction (decision-maker cares about team happiness)

## Objection Handling:

### **"We're too busy for a 2-week analysis"**
"That's exactly why you need this. TechCorp's manager said the same thing - they were drowning. The 2 weeks of analysis saved them 2+ hours per agent per day. ROI started immediately."

### **"Sounds expensive"**
"The real expense is hiring 3 more agents at $75K each plus benefits - that's $225K+ annually. Our entire engagement costs less than one new hire's salary."

### **"We tried automation tools before"**
"Generic automation tools fail because they don't understand your specific workflow. We don't build until we've mapped every click your team makes. That's why our extensions feel native."

### **"What if our workflow changes?"**
"That's the beauty of custom development. We build it to adapt to your process, and any major changes are just an update, not a complete rebuild."

This Changes Your Pitch Strategy:
Your Process = Premium Positioning

"Weeks mapping workflow" = thoroughness, not just another SaaS tool
Shows you're consultative, not transactional
Justifies higher pricing (custom work vs off-the-shelf)

Updated Value Props:

"We study your workflow like engineers" - builds trust
"Quick wins while building" - highlight text/copy-paste demos
"Built for your exact process" - not generic automation

Revised Pitch Angles:
For the Cold Email:
Add this credibility builder:

"Our process: We spend 2-3 weeks studying your exact workflow (screen recordings, shadowing agents, mapping every click). Then we build something that feels like it was always part of your system."

For Discovery Calls:

Week 1-2: Workflow analysis & quick wins demo
Week 3-4: Custom extension development
Week 5: Testing & refinement
Result: 40-60% efficiency gains that stick

Social Proof Enhancement:

"TechCorp sent us screen recordings of their agents handling escalations. We identified 47 unnecessary clicks per ticket. Our extension eliminated 43 of them."

This Actually Differentiates You:

Zapier = generic workflows
Your approach = forensic workflow analysis + custom code
You're positioning as workflow consultants who happen to build extensions

Want me to update the cold email with this positioning? The "weeks of analysis" actually makes you sound more premium, not slower.
